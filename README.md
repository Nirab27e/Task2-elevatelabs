#  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“ ElevateLabs Task 2

 The task involves performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset using Python.

## Objective
 **Understand the data through statistics and visualizations** to uncover patterns, relationships, and insights.
 
##  Dataset
The dataset used is the **Titanic Passenger Dataset**, which includes passenger details like age, sex, class, fare, and survival status.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** â€“ Data handling
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** â€“ Data visualization
- **Plotly** *(optional)* â€“ Interactive plotting
- **VS Code** â€“ Development environment

## ðŸ§ª Steps Performed

### âœ… Step 1: Summary Statistics
- Generated descriptive statistics: mean, median, standard deviation, etc.

### âœ… Step 2: Visualizations
- Histograms and boxplots for numerical features

### âœ… Step 3: Feature Relationships
- Correlation matrix
- Pairplot (colored by survival)

### âœ… Step 4: Pattern & Anomaly Detection
- Detected skewed fare values
- Found high correlation between class and fare

### âœ… Step 5: Feature-Level Inference
- Inferred survival rates based on age, class, fare, and family relationship

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights

- Most passengers were in **3rd class** with lower survival rates.
- **Higher fare** and **1st class** passengers had **higher survival chances**.
- Most people traveled **alone** (no siblings/spouses or parents/children).
- **Fare** and **Age** have outliers that influence analysis.
